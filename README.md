This project was updated from colordodge's infinite terrain, but it was dated in it's threejs code.

I updated this to r160 I think maybe r159.

This took me like 20 hours to do, passion project. I love infinite terrain projects. This is my first ever threejs conversion, any input would be greatly appreciated.
